## FAQ ##

#### Shippify does not appear as a shipping method in checkout. ####
  - Check the configuration of your shipping zones. Selected country and/or entered zip code must match with the ones configured on the shipping zone.
  - Check in WooCommerce General Settings if you have specified your desired shipping location(s).
